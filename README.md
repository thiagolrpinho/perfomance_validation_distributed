# Perfomance Validation with Text Processing and Classification
 
This repo is used to develop and evaluate some text processing and 
classification functions available in common libraries and frameworks.

## PySpark Speed

This folder contains a notebook where it's possible to evaluate how 
faster pyspark is relative to the same operations using common open
source community libraries(spacy and sklearn).

## Clustering

Thi folder contains a notebook with two clustering algorithms used 
in open source community: k-means and a siamese manhattan LSTM(soon)
